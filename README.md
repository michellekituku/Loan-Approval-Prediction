# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details.  
It applies **classification models** like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Explored the dataset (EDA) to understand patterns in loan approvals.
- Preprocessed categorical and missing data.
- Compared multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix**.
- Visualized important features driving loan approvals.

## 📊 Results
- Best performing model: **Random Forest** .
- Accuracy ≈ 82%, ROC-AUC ≈ 72%.
- Key features influencing predictions: **Credit History, ApplicantIncome, Loan_ID**.
